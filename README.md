# NBA-Data-Analysis-Project
A Python script to visualize and analyze NBA player stats (1997-2022). Compare players' career trajectories for points, assists, and True Shooting % using plots and regression models. Includes special analyses on the league's 3-point revolution. An sqlite table is initialized in the data folder after execution of the python script, which it uses to gather data from player seasons.
